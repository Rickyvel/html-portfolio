<hr />
<h3>Rambo</h3>
<p>I love this film because Sylvester Stalone is my favourite actor and i love to see him in action takin on the bad guys</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>The reason i love this film is because it touches me to see how the love story of two people develpoed and the things you would sacrifice for the one you love</p>
<h3>Gone in Sixty Seconds</h3>
<p>This movie is the best car show for me as i love watching these type of movies that depicts car technology and it also has a good storyline</p>
